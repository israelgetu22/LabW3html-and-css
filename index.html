        Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the
        local club Andorinha. (The name Ronaldo was added to Cristiano’s name in
        honour of his father’s favourite movie actor, Ronald Reagan, who was
        U.S. president at the time of Cristiano’s birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was
        diagnosed with a heart condition that necessitated surgery, but he was
        sidelined only briefly and made a full recovery. He first played for
        Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting
        Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting Lisbon), where he played for that
        club’s various youth teams before making his debut on Sporting’s first
        team in 2002.
